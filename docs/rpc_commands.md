4. Wallet create - `/wallet/create`
<details>
<summary>This API endpoint is used to initialize a wallet when starting lnd for the first time.</summary>
The `/api/v1/wallet/create` API is used when lnd is starting up for the first time to fully initialize the daemon and its internal wallet. At a minimum, a wallet passphrase must be provided. This passphrase is used to encrypt sensitive material on disk. 

In a recovery scenario, the user can also specify their aezeed mnemonic and passphrase. If set, the daemon will use this prior state to initialize its internal wallet.

Alternatively, this API can be used along with the `/util/seed/create` API to obtain a seed. Once the seed has been verified by the user, it can be fed into this API to commit the new wallet.

## Request

The request should be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `wallet_passphrase` (string, required): The passphrase that should be used to encrypt the wallet. It must be at least 8 characters in length. After creation, this password is required to unlock the daemon.

- `wallet_passphrase_bin` ([]byte, optional): If specified, it will override `wallet_passphrase`, but is expressed in binary. When using REST, this field must be encoded as base64.

- `wallet_seed` (string array, optional): A 15-word wallet seed. This may have been generated by the `GenSeed` method or be an existing seed.

- `seed_passphrase` (string, optional): An optional user-provided passphrase that will be used to encrypt the generated seed.

- `seed_passphrase_bin` ([]byte, optional): If specified, it will override `seed_passphrase`, but is expressed in binary. When using REST, this field must be encoded as base64.

- `recovery_window` (int32, optional): An optional argument specifying the address lookahead when restoring a wallet seed. The recovery window applies to each individual branch of the BIP44 derivation paths. Supplying a recovery window of zero indicates that no addresses should be recovered, such as after the first initialization of the wallet.

- `channel_backups` (object, optional): An optional argument that allows clients to recover the settled funds within a set of channels. This should be populated if the user was unable to close out all channels and sweep funds before partial or total data loss occurred. If specified, after on-chain recovery of funds, lnd will begin to carry out the data loss recovery protocol to recover the funds in each channel from a remote force closed transaction.

- `wallet_name` (string, optional): An optional argument that allows defining the wallet filename other than the default `wallet.db`.

## Response

The response is a JSON object with the following field:

- `null`: Indicates a successful wallet initialization.

11. Create transaction - `/wallet/transaction/create`
 <details>
<summary>Create a transaction but do not send it to the chain. This does not store the transaction as existing in the wallet so ```/wallet/transaction/query``` will not return a transaction created by this endpoint. In order to make multiple transactions concurrently, prior to the first transaction being submitted to the chain, you must specify the autolock field.</summary>
</details>

#### Request
* to_address: The address to which the payment will be made. (Type: string)
* amount: The number of PKT (crypto token) to send. Use Infinity to send as much as possible in a single transaction. (Type: float64)
* from_address (repeated): Addresses from which funds can be sourced. (Type: array of strings)
* electrum_format: Output an electrum format transaction. This format carries additional payload for enabling offline transactions, including multi-signature. (Type: boolean)
* change_address: If not an empty string, this address will be used for making change. (Type: string)
* input_min_height: Do not source funds from any transaction outputs with a block height less than this value. (Type: int32)
* min_conf: Do not source funds from any transaction outputs unless they have at least this many confirmations. (Type: int32)
* max_inputs: Do not use more than this number of previous transaction outputs as inputs to source funds. (Type: int32)
* autolock: Create a "named lock" for all outputs to be spent. This allows you to prevent further invocations of creating a transaction from referencing the same coins. The name is your * choice. The locked outputs will be unlocked on wallet restart, by using wallet/unspent/lock/create with unlock = true, or if the transaction is sent to the chain (in which case they become permanently unusable). (Type: string)
* sign: Specify whether to sign the transaction. (Type: boolean)

Example:
```json
{
  "to_address":"pkt1qy4egewsutha4pqxarndfr9w4g3n4rhh47amu5u",
  "amount":10,

* end_height (type: int32): The height until which to list transactions, inclusive. To include unconfirmed transactions, set this value to -1. If no end_height is provided, the call will default to this option.
* txns_limit (type: int32): Return no more than this number of transactions within the specified height range.
* txns_skip (type: int32): Skip this number of the first transactions to allow windowing over the set of all transactions.

#### Request

* to_address (string): The address to send funds to.
amount (float64): The amount of coins to send, denominated in whole PKT. Setting the value to "Infinity" means sending as much as possible. The maximum amount possible depends on fees and the limited maximum number of inputs. To completely sweep an address, you may need to call this endpoint multiple times.
